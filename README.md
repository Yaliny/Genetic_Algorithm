# Genetic_Algorithm
Solvig of the Knapsack optimization problem using genetic algorithm (C# implementation)

This is the C# implementation of genetic algorithm for finding
the optimal solution of the Knapsack problem.

Solving is avaliable for 5, 10, 15 and 20 items with predefined
weights and values. However, population size and number of
generations are customized, as well as crossover and
mutation possibilities.

Solving can be performed in two modes: step by step with output
of the current population on every step, and automatic
calculation with output of the final population
and the best solution.

The programm should be used in educational process for exploring 
the properties of genetic algorithm and dependency of its 
eficiency from algorithm parameters.
